Telefónica Telecommunications (Argentina): Enhancing Customer Experience in Software Quality Assurance,https://www.getronics.com/telefonica-telecommunications-movistar-argentina-agile-transformation/,"A recent collaboration with Getronics significantly improved the quality and reliability of the mobile app experience for one of the country’s leading telecommunications companies. Partnering with one of the largest telecommunications companies in Argentina, Getronics contributes to the continuous innovation of the client’s mobile app, implementing quality assurance services with agile methodologies. Telefónica Telecommunications, S. A. is a Spanish multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Madrid. It is the fourth-largest telecommunications company in Europe and the thirteenth worldwide. In Argentina, Movistar, the brand representing Telefónica, has over 11,000 employees and more than 16 million users. The Challenge Movistar Argentina needed to implement a new service adopting agile methodologies with innovative, faster, and more effective solutions for its users to ensure the functionality of its platforms. The goal was to implement a Testing Factory & QA service, covering compatibility, accessibility, performance, automation, and UX/UI testing, with a service model based on indicators and KPIs. Getronics presented a superior proposal that met the high industry standards required by the client. With proven experience in the telecommunications market, and extensive business knowledge, we supported Movistar Argentina in meeting this new challenge. The Solution Getronics acted as a key partner, working closely with the Movistar Argentina team to raise the quality standards of the mobile app. From the start, our approach was collaborative and results-oriented. We implemented a comprehensive set of functional and non-functional tests which were designed to ensure the reliability of performance on their mobile app, Mi Movistar. This process included new testing standards and procedures, which gave complete coverage at every stage of development. We created a collaborative space known as the Certification Discipline. Here, we worked closely to strengthen and improve software certification practices. As needs and challenges evolved, we expanded this space to include new agile teams. We applied specialised procedures in compatibility, accessibility, performance, automation, and user experience (UX/UI) testing, among other critical research areas. Key Results After the changes were made, Movistar Argentina reported significant results in terms of quality: Early Deliveries: The first MVP with the new software architecture was achieved in just 3 months. Improved Product Quality: We detected and resolved over 2,000 code defects in certification environments. We executed over 3,500 automated regressions, saving more than 3,100 hours in manual testing time. We improved accessibility with over 40,000 test cases. Expansion of Agile Culture: Since 2020, the service has been growing steadily, with a current average of 11,000 hours of execution per month. Creation of the Certification Discipline group, defining processes for functional, non-functional, and automated testing. Top 1 Telecommunications App in the Market: In partnership with the Movistar team, we improved the NPS (Net Promoter Score) in the Android and iOS stores. Alliance with Getronics as a Strategic Technology Partner, with over 20 years of collaboration. At Getronics, we will continue to refine and professionalise the Certification Discipline while continuing to innovate to contribute to Movistar’s ongoing success, with a focus on user experience. We are committed to creating long-term value, which is sustainable, innovative, and profitable. * In software development, “regression” refers to re-executing previous tests to ensure recent changes have not introduced new errors. This process is essential to maintain the quality and stability of the software, and automating these tests saves time and resources, ensuring continuous delivery of solutions without compromising existing functionality."
"The Council of Justice, Andalusia (Spain) relies on Getronics for ICT project management",https://www.getronics.com/the-council-of-justice-andalusia-spain-relies-on-getronics-for-ict-project-management/,"The Council of Justice, Local Administration, and Public Function of Andalusia is responsible for managing public sector competences in the Spanish region. It encompasses a wide range of services and projects related to information systems. They now rely on Getronics for optimising their ICT project management. The Council of Justice faced the challenge of improving the control and monitoring of its information systems development projects. To address this need, it issued a tender to hire the best professional services required to help the Council achieve its objectives.

Getronics Transforms Electronic Signature Services for RedIRIS,https://www.getronics.com/getronics-transforms-electronic-signature-services-for-rediris/,"The deployment of an electronic signature validation system, @firma, in addition to that offered by the Ministry of Digital Transformation and Public Function, allows RedIRIS to offer a more stable and efficient service to its 500 associated institutions. A New Requirement RedIRIS is the Spanish academic and research network providing advanced communication services to the national scientific and university community. It is managed directly by the Public Business Entity Red. es and funded by the Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities. With over 500 affiliated institutions (mostly universities and research centres), RedIRIS, through its collaboration with Crue Digitalisation, identified the need to complement the @firma service provided by the General Secretariat of Digital Administration (SGAD) of the Ministry of Digital Transformation and Public Function with a federated @firma service. This would ensure that all institutions affiliated with RedIRIS have additional access to the @firma service, which is critical for the various e-administration processes that these institutions must constantly carry out. RedIRIS needed to implement a technical infrastructure and services to meet the technological, operational, continuity, and demand needs of this service for potential users. Additionally, it required specialised support services to administer, maintain, operate, and manage the @firma electronic signature validation platform and address queries and incidents related to that platform. A Scalable Solution Getronics proposed the implementation of a scalable infrastructure solution with a cluster for managing the @firma platform. This platform included high-level security and traffic control components to handle the volume of required requests. Furthermore, a Business Intelligence (BI) solution was proposed for data exploitation, allowing proactive decision-making processes and enabling the service to adapt to fluctuations in demand. This platform also met the following key objectives for the project’s success: Integrate all information into a single analytical platform for generating customised and on-demand reports. Create a web-based dashboard generation system to enable service management to analyse service metrics and extract useful information. Ensure the platform was “self-service” so that decision-makers could generate their own reports in real-time and on-demand, without relying on IT teams. Facilitate advanced analytics to shift from reaction to anticipation, thanks to the application of Machine Learning, thus obtaining predictive models that allow managing infrastructure capacity based on available historical information. Include indicator categories such as data quality and business, such as the degree of service usage/penetration. Of course, the project was not without challenges. Coordination between different work teams was crucial to implementing the platform, including the provision of infrastructure, technical support, application development, and data analytics. Additionally, integration with the client’s systems and connections with their security and traffic systems was one of the biggest challenges for the Getronics teams. The Achieved Benefits The new electronic signature platform adds value to users compared to solely relying on the SGAD service, with which this additional deployment has been coordinated. They now have a maintenance service for platform management, incident, and problem management. Moreover, the maintenance plan is proactive through the analysis of patches, updates of new versions, capacity planning, and anticipation of problem detection. They have support services for the integration of affiliated systems with the @firma platform, including service requests and technical/functional advice. The Business Intelligence platform allows analysing platform information, with a view to improving system understanding and thus anticipating future problems. This successful collaboration between RedIRIS and Getronics resulted in the establishment of a robust electronic signature validation platform tailored to the needs of RedIRIS-affiliated institutions, ensuring higher quality, reliability, and efficiency of the service. “This project has been a complete success due to our experience in implementing similar solutions for other clients. Currently, Getronics provides operation, administration, and support services for the second largest implementation of @firma after SGAD, and the first federated platform in terms of service provision volume. This makes us well-acquainted with the solution and able to offer the best option to each administration or company” Federico Real, Service Delivery Manager at Getronics"

Transforming MEZ Group digital fabric,https://www.getronics.com/transforming-mez-group-digital-fabric-cloud-platform/,"A new cloud computing solution has transformed MEZ Group operations. Replacing outdated software and systems with a new integrated cloud platform has optimised operations and supercharged security. The cloud has changed MEZ’s digital fabric, providing a foundation for business growth. Outdated systems MEZ Group has customers worldwide for its high-quality yarns and craft accessories. The business had enjoyed substantial online growth but struggled with old technology and software. Limitations caused by legacy platforms meant the company found itself unable to deal with rapidly changing customer demands. More worryingly, such systems weren’t secure, leaving the business at risk of attack. Business leaders understood the critical importance of digital infrastructure to expansion. While customer data always remained protected, the MEZ Group leadership team was aware of emerging threats and wanted to increase protection for the future. The solution was a shift from legacy systems to an integrated cloud solution. Migrating to the cloud The project began by analysing MEZ Group requirements, strategy, and existing software and hardware to identify a suitable solution. Working with the in-house digital team, we defined deliverables and developed a digital road map. Microsoft Azure was agreed upon as the most suitable cloud platform for security and scalability. “Our previous, on-premise infrastructure was very inflexible. Due to the seasonal nature of the fashion industry, the ability to scale up or down to meet rapidly changing demand was crucial to our success. Therefore, the additional flexibility provided by the Azure cloud platform is a huge benefit.” Claudia, Gebhart – Head of IT, MEZ Group MEZ Group transitioned to a consumption-based pricing plan, where the business only pays for the services and capacity used. This has delivered tremendous cost savings while providing greater transparency and predictability. As a result, the business has experienced cost savings of 50% – which is having a significant impact on the business’s profitability in an increasingly challenging market. Tailor-made Solutions: IT-as-a-Service Cloud solutions enable the customisation of services and software for each user. MEZ Group now uses a persona-based consumption model, where staff has access to the software they need to perform their roles. This IT-as-a-service approach has considerably impacted cutting operating costs and increased security. Light users, for example, may only have access to basic licenses and small amounts of support. Standard users may have their own computers and access to a much wider range of software. Introducing a persona-based IT-as-a-Service model enables MEZ Group to make the most efficient use of resources. Licenses are only produced and paid for those staff that need them. In the first three months alone, this helped the business to cut licensing costs by 20%. Operating an IT-as-a-service model gives the MEZ Group total control over which users have access to software, systems, and data. In addition, tiered access provides peace of mind and protection for all customer data, ensuring only those who need access to it have it. Building a secure system MEZ Groups machines, software, and systems have all been updated. Advanced endpoint protection, device monitoring, and patch management provide confidence that systems remain secure. To support the roll-out of the cloud, clear governance rules were developed to limit access to sensitive data. The business benefits from more robust data reporting and compliance standards. These add extra levels of protection for information, systems, and staff. Leaders can be confident that they have the highest protection from digital dangers and online threats. Redesigning the digital fabric of a business? Digital transformation is an ongoing process – and we’re proud to partner with MEZ Group for the long term. Together, we have completely redesigned the digital fabric of the business, providing a secure foundation for growth. As well as supercharging security, our digital solutions deliver significant savings – giving MEZ Group the confidence to invest for the future. “Working in partnership with Getronics, we have reshaped the company’s IT services, accessing new benefits around cost, security, and efficiency. Now, we have confidence that our entire business is ready for the journey ahead.” Claudia, Gebhart – Head of IT, MEZ Group"
Clínica de Girona: unified communications to transform patient care,https://www.getronics.com/clinica-de-girona-unified-communications-to-transform-patient-care/,"Getronics is working with Spanish healthcare provider Clínica de Girona to introduce innovative new technology to its new hospital. The unified communications system is transforming care and improving patient outcomes. Download this case study in PDF (English) Clínica de Girona is one of Spain’s most respected surgical and medical healthcare providers. Founded in 1934, the Clínica de Girona has invested in a new state-of-the-art hospital that’s three times larger than the building it replaces. The new Girona Clinic offers incredible facilities for patients, including: ?120 in-patient beds ?eight intelligent, high-definition operating rooms ?three delivery rooms and three for endoscopy?eight boxes in the intensive care unit (ICU) and ten emergency boxes ?a day hospital areaoncology, and pain medicine, with 20 individual boxes?a minor outpatient surgery room ?hemodialysis rooms Behind the scenes, patients are supported by various services, including permanent diagnostic imaging, clinical analysis, and pathological anatomy services. A comprehensive communication system Designing the new building has been a great challenge but presents a unique opportunity for Clínica de Girona to modernise its communication systems – and they selected Getronics as their partner. Clínica de Girona wanted to move from disparate communication systems to a comprehensive solution. Within the new facility, innovative IP-based communications were needed to streamline hospital processes and improve clinical diagnosis and treatment. The key is providing clinicians with the right information at the right time, empowering them to make the best decisions for every patient. What Getronics did 1. Communications that power clinical decision-making In the bustling Clínica de Girona hospital, agency staff and external contractors work alongside employees, sharing information and insights to improve diagnosis and treatment. Clinicians at Clínica de Girona use a range of tools, technologies, and communication systems to deliver patient care, but the existing system was slow and inefficient. The challenge for Getronics was to develop an integrated communications platform that maintains an individual’s operation freedom but integrates them into the core system. Getronics’ solution was to introduce a state-of-the-art telephony platform, the NEC SV9500, to power communication and collaboration. The platform integrates the management and automation of hospital processes, providing essential information to clinicians when needed. The new solution transforms a confusing tangle of hardware devices and cables into an easily accessible software application. The system is scalable, making it easy to add functionality and integrate new systems and services. We call it liquid telephony, and it’s at the heart of transforming patient care at Clínica de Girona. 2. Unified communications throughout the clinic Clinicians use standard processes when treating patients, but detailed information which was spread across various systems. Getronics’ solution was to unify communications processes, giving instant access to those in the clinic. Clinicians can now access crucial data on processes in a single place. The system covers all critical communication processes, including patient care and nursing. Access to protocols ensures that procedures are followed in a medical emergency, such as a stroke, heart attack or a patient requiring CPR. Clinicians aren’t stuck to a desk but need information on the move. So, we built the platform using wireless IP DECT technology. As well as enabling clinicians to access the information they need wherever they are, installation costs are lower when compared to traditional systems. 3. Robust security Any system failure could threaten patients’ lives, so we built on the strongest foundations. As a result, our engineers have developed a system that’s guaranteed to deliver an incredible 99.999% of uptime. 4. Controlling cost-centres Getronics’ solution converts telephony into an application enabling Clinica de Girona to capture it for other applications. The system automatically calculates costs and enables each department to be billed based on usage, not estimates and guesswork. Delivering impact from day one Getronics has worked closely with Clinica de Girona to ensure the system and solution are effective from the minute the clinic opened for patients. We delivered the new communication system on time and within budget. The new communications system: includes over 600 extensions and fixed IP terminals connected and IP DECT wireless solution supporting 100 healthcare professionalsprovides a secure connection to the public network via IP link SIP standarddelivers access to applications for the patient care centre and unified communicationssupports secure remote workingenables smart processing and the automation of communication protocols for emergencies and medical processesensures accurate budget management and control applications.

FROB: Finance and technology come together to deliver a personal service,https://www.getronics.com/finance-and-technology-come-together-to-deliver-a-personal-service-for-frob/,"While we initially only provided cloud services to FROB, Getronics now delivers a range of services in the areas of cloud, workspace, and security About FROB Fondo de Reestructuración Ordenada Bancaria (FROB) is a Spanish public entity in charge of restructuring credit institutions, investment firms, and banks. FROB was founded in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis with the remit of strengthening and stabilising the Spanish banking system. For example, in cases where a financial entity is failing (or likely to fail), there are no private solutions that could remedy the situation, and resolving the institution’s insolvency is deemed to be of public interest, then FROB will manage the execution of the resolution process. A long-standing relationship Getronics is best known as a technology provider and its customers recognise the company for the importance it places on human relationships. This is exemplified by the partnership that we have developed with FROB over many years. FROB has actually been working with some of our employees for more than 10 years. Although FROB was initially a customer of Colt, a UK-based technology supplier, Colt sold its cloud business to Getronics in 2016. Following the acquisition, much of the technology and many of the staff transferred from Colt to Getronics, allowing FROB to enjoy continuity of service. Expanding our services Although Getronics has maintained and strengthened the personal relationships that FROB has grown accustomed to over many years, we have also ramped up our service offering from a technology standpoint. While we initially only provided cloud services, Getronics now delivers a range of services in the areas of cloud, workspace and security. Our Microsoft 365 offering includes the Hybrid Exchange and SharePoint platforms, as well as OneDrive and Teams. Our workspace services, meanwhile, are available for all 50 users of FROB and encompass Intune Mobile Device Management (MDM) for desktops and mobile devices, Network Access Management (NAC), Remote L2 support and OnSite L1 support. Building trust Because of FROB’s work within the financial industry, the organisation frequently handles information of a sensitive nature. As such, it requires security services to be of the highest quality. FROB’s partnership with Getronics allows it to access services like Azure Information Protection (AIP), Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Information Rights Management (IRM), firewalls, Cloud App Security and our anti-DDoS solution. In fact, FROB is Getronics’ first customer in Spain to benefit from our Security Operations Centre (SOC) services – reinforcing the close relationship between the two companies. Results and benefits Getronics is working with FROB to ensure that it can continue to deliver its services to the financial sector in Spain, providing added stability to an industry that is fundamental to a functioning economy. Some of the benefits of partnering with Getronics include: A single IT Infrastructure providerReduced operating costsReduced maintenance costsImproved customer end-user experienceIncreased security of FROB infrastructureStandardised services In addition, we provide FROB with a dedicated SDM and customer solution engineer, as well as a project officer that can provide technical updates and support digital transformation efforts. Getronics recently signed an extension of its contract with FROB in December 2020, and we look forward to working together for many more years to come."
ESIGN: agile development in our changing world,https://www.getronics.com/agile-development-in-our-changing-world/,"Thanks to the support of Getronics and an agile development approach, ESIGN was able to accelerate its digital transformation with 10 products released in record time and under demanding conditions – such as the pandemic. ESING building in Santiago de Chile About ESIGN ESIGN is dedicated to digital identity and cybersecurity, providing innovative solutions to achieve the digital transformation of companies in Chile and Latin America. With over 16 years of experience and around 100 professionals, ESIGN is highly specialized in technological products and services for digital transformation. Location ESIGN headquarters are located in Santiago de Chile with operations in Colombia and clients in various Latin American countries. Activity ESIGN creates technological solutions to make the world a simpler and more reliable place through electronic signatures, and cybersecurity – among others. Challenge Given the accelerated process of digital transformation that companies and organizations are facing, it is essential to have conditions and solutions that accompany the changing and demanding needs of the market. From there, for ESIGN and its challenging vision in the innovation of products and services, it was essential to have a product development team that not only has strong technical capabilities and agile culture but also skills that favor and facilitate the formation of high-performance teams. Background ESIGN provides information technologies with end-to-end solutions – across all industries. For more than 16 years, these technological solutions have been born with the purpose of making the world a simpler and more reliable place, where digital identity is an enabling condition for all operational and commercial processes of its clients. Given the pandemic, this need was increased, especially in sectors where their main processes were made up of manual, face-to-face, or highly paper-based procedures; a great pain for companies and their people when these same processes had to become remote and digital. This is where ESIGN acts as a strategic partner, delivering robust models of authentication and validation of people’s identity and acting as a trusted third-party certifying that the person is who they say they are. Ultimately, delivering a simple and easy method for signing all kinds of documents such as employment and commercial contracts, medical prescriptions, and powers of attorney, among others. The digital transformation of ESIGN ESIGN is in a process of internal digital transformation, incorporating an agile culture into all its work – whether technological, commercial, or strategic. Based on this agile model and highly innovative vocation, ESIGN has been creating and improving products in an accelerated way to meet the new and growing needs of its customers. In this dizzying challenge, it has been necessary to have professionals who have the technical knowledge and requisite skill sets that allow them to adapt to the culture that ESIGN has been cultivating. This is where it has been required to have a strategic partner to accompany the search and selection of the most suitable IT professionals, which has been possible thanks to the support of Getronics. With extensive experience in agile models, the Getronics team developed the anchor solution for current ESIGN products and services and its brands, which began with the government project, “FEA Challenge”, of which ESIGN wanted to be part. Getronics created a suite of identity authentication, validation, and document signatory by using the Unique Password control of the Ministry of Economy. This ensured that a company could be set up in 24 hours by using an Advanced Electronic Signature, which was 100% online. This same service was implemented in ESIGN solutions and products, which allowed them to strengthen their value proposition to their customers and to the wider market. Agile development in a changing world Thanks to the support of Getronics, ESIGN was able to accelerate its innovation funnel with 10 products released in record time and under demanding conditions – such as the pandemic. Beyond that, it has maintained the model implemented by Getronics becoming the reference framework for the future. “The technical and mainly human team that Getronics provided for the ESIGN projects were a key element for the success of each challenge we set ourselves.”Gonzalo Yáñez, Technology and Transformation Manager Why Getronics? Getronics has become a strategic partner to meet the objectives of ESIGN. With a close, flexible style and aligned with the needs of ESIGN’s technological area, Getronics have solved the increasingly challenging task of providing a high-performance technical team. We have developed a relationship of trust that has allowed us to ensure sustained growth, and which we hope to maintain for many more years. The future ESIGN has a strategy of market expansion and automation in its work, with the purpose of continuing to scale in solutions to fulfill its purpose, which is: to create technological solutions to make the world a simpler and more reliable place."
PSMar: digital transformation to improve patient experience,https://www.getronics.com/improving-patient-care-experience-for-psmar/,"Getronics is helping Mar Parc de Salut Consortium (PSMar) transform patient care and improve outcomes. We’ve redesigned and re-engineered the communication system to create a robust solution that supports staff and benefits patients. About PSMar Barcelona-based PSMar is one of Spain’s most dynamic healthcare hubs. It’s a centre of excellence in knowledge, education, and research. The PSMar consortium brings together different municipal public healthcare services, including the hospital services of Hospital Del Mar and Hospital de Esperança, as well as several other institutes and research centres. PSMar’s campus covers 10 buildings, housing many public healthcare services, including teaching and research facilities. PSMar employs over 2,000 members of staff who treat thousands of patients every year. The organisation was reliant on outdated, expensive, and inefficient communication systems. PSMar was searching for a provider to deliver an integrated management model to improve the quality of the services. Existing systems and new processes were brought together into a single solution under one brand. The challenge PSMar challenged Getronics to integrate and optimise systems and processes. Critical to the project was the ability to protect patient data and improve medical and security procedures, all within a tight budget. Elisabet Izquierdo, director of General Services and Infrastructure at PSMar, describes her vision for the hospital of the future. Elisabet believes hospitals must be sustainable and incorporate new technologies where possible. (The film is in Catalan) We reviewed the current infrastructure and identified an opportunity to integrate all communication processes between all the buildings and units across the campus. Streamlining the system would enable us to improve the quality of all services. We could also guarantee the security and privacy of each unit, including both personnel and patients. A single system could reduce IT, including maintenance and medical process expenses. The solution Getronics designed, implemented, installed, and configured a Unified Communications (UC) network across all PSMar properties. The system covers all hospitals, offices, support centres, and centres for psychiatry, training, and research. Our comprehensive UC solution uses an NEC SIP@Net server to deliver services to PSMar’s 2,000 staff. We introduced a range of technologies to improve communications, including: IP DECT for mobility, external contact centre, internal contact centre (IT helpdesk)a solution for virtual meeting roomsCEBP (communications-enabled business process) for automation of SOS processes, CRA (cardiorespiratory arrest) and ICTUScomplete IP Nurse Call system integrated within the UC platform Our unrivalled expertise in supporting healthcare providers and public services has enabled us to create an integrated platform built for growth. We’ve been able to add new functionality, which is enabling PSMar to work more effectively, including: geolocation of patients in emergency areasgeneral geolocation of assets and patientsSmart Building + Smart Hospital technology “Getronics has helped us on our way to transforming an outdated telecommunications infrastructure, turning it into a converged solution and, in general, improving our key procedures. They have also helped us in the implementation of the different solutions for the improvement of security of patients and professionals (CPR and panic button)”. Elisabet Izquierdo, Director of General Services and Infrastructure Results and benefits This ambitious project has improved the experience of both staff and patients at PSMar. Teams can rely on a robust communication system enabling them to focus on day-to-day priorities and improve performance. Patients benefit from shorter waiting times and greater information. Patients have more information on their care and can get answers to essential queries faster than ever before. PSMar now benefits from: single pane of glass/single control pointreduced operating costslower maintenance costsimproved experience for patients, their families, and visitorsincreased security for critical proceduresstandardised services “We appreciate Getronics’ special emphasis and focus on the user experience, which includes our staff, patients and even the patient’s family. This is key and a priority for us.”Elizabeth Izquierdo, Director of General Services and Infrastructure The future We’re growing our relationship with PSMar and are working on an asset geolocation solution in the surgical block. Another project is a patient geolocation pilot within the hospital to improve the use of the boxes to reduce emergency waiting times and improve the patient experience. During the pilot, Getronics is testing a new technology that uses AoA (Angle of Arrival) to accurately identify and calculate each patient’s location as they move through the facility. We’re proud of our impact on performance and the patient experience at PSMar. Getronics is excited to partner PSMar on its journey to develop new solutions and innovations."
Crédit Agricole: a rationalized and secure data center,https://www.getronics.com/credit-agricole-case-study/,"Every day, Crédit Agricole supports its 50 million clients with business, family, and personal finance – with the Getronics service portfolio by their side. Getronics designed, built, and ran a complex cloud environment, including a robust security solution, monitored by the Getronics’ SOC. About Crédit Agricole Vita Headquartered in Milan, Italy, with around 300 employees. Crédit Agricole Vita S.p.A. uses the Crédit Agricole Italia Banking Group branch network to make available its services and products to its clients. Every day, 50,000 consultants are in contact with 50 million clients assisting them in all of their business, family and personal projects: this is one of the reasons why Crédit Agricole Assurances is the leading Bancassurer in Europe. Integrating a complex DC ecosystem Credit Agricole Vita has been an active Getronics customer for more than 10 years. In 2016 we were offering the hosting service of some virtual machines and physical servers for IT management. At that time, the customer had all its core services installed and managed in different providers and data centers in Italy. In 2017 they launched a strategic RFP called DCR (Data Centre Rationalisation), looking for one single IT partner that could insource and manage all the systems. In 2018, Getronics won the RFP, followed by the successful completion of the DCR project. Today, we manage more than double the IT environments originally estimated at the start of the DCR. End-to-end and secure-by-design In the Milan Getronics’ data center, we designed, built, and ran a complex cloud environment (based on Cisco Technology). We then added a robust security solution, monitored by the Getronics’ SOC where hundreds of VMs, together with their databases, are daily managed in full compliance with GDPR, ISO27001 standards, and rigid SLAs. All VMs are replicated with DRAAS in the Paris Getronics’ data center. As a result, Credit Agricole Vita has now one single IT provider managing all of the core services with a huge cost saving generated by the insourcing completed in the last 2 years. Since having all the environments managed by Getronics, the customer also generated a big improvement in customer satisfaction, in terms of KPIs. Why Getronics? We don’t see ourselves as an IT services provider merely answering an RFP. We are the IT business partner that listens to customer needs and always brings tangible, proven, successful results with a long-term view on client satisfaction and digital experience. Security also played an important role in this deal: Getronics does not deliver any IT service if there is not a strong security layer installed behind – checked and guaranteed. This approach underlies any new project with Credit Agricole Vita, and it’s the main reason for the success and strong relationship we are having together with our client. "

Gatwick Airports: sky-high quality support,https://www.getronics.com/gatwick-case-study/,"
Gatwick Airports needed a partner that would be adaptable and flexible, as well as a team that would efficiently work to tight timescales in a short period to ensure a successful transition and improved service. Getronics demonstrate to Gatwick their ability to provide a higher quality service desk, a flexible approach to delivering service excellence and introduce best-in-class user interaction which translates to improved customer satisfaction. About Gatwick Gatwick Airport is the UK’s second-largest airport and is owned by a group of international investment funds, of which Global Infrastructure Partners is the majority shareholder. Today, Gatwick employs around 2,500 people and supports over 23,000 individuals through the different airlines, handlers, and retail partners. The airport has over 34.2 million passengers traveling through its two terminals annually, traveling to around 200  destinations in 90 countries, and is the world’s busiest single-use runway with up to 53 aircraft movements per hour during peak season. Driving Growth Through Experience As part of Gatwick’s wider strategic objectives to help their airlines grow and to provide an exceptional passenger experience, they required an agile service provider that could help them on their transformation journey whilst managing cost and delivering innovation using current and future technology platforms, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and other cloud-based offerings. They needed a partner that would be adaptable and flexible, as well as a team that would efficiently work to tight timescales in a short period to ensure a successful transition and improved service. Crucially, they needed a supplier that would work cooperatively and effectively with the airport’s other suppliers. Previously, this had always been a challenge, with suppliers competing with each other and not necessarily acting with the airport’s best interests at heart. Midway through the tender process, a new CIO, Michael Ibbitson, joined the team to lead the transformation journey, bringing with him his own distinct views on how he wanted the airport to provide a truly great customer experience. Therefore they had to adapt their approach and strategy, and Getronics had to adjust in accordance with this. Specifically, Gatwick’s IT Service Desk was a pain point and so Gatwick’s focus was firmly on increasing end-user satisfaction. Also, their applications needed to reduce in complexity and Gatwick recognized opportunities to create applications that delivered innovative ways for passengers to interact with the airport, thereby improving their customer experience. Record-Time Transformation Getronics won the contract in a competitive pitch against 25 other providers to deliver the airport’s Service Desk, Service Management, and Applications Management. As part of its wider IT transformation strategy, the airport needed Getronics to overhaul its Service Desk, make significant improvements in the way the service was delivered, fix issues, namely customer service, operational processes and service levels, and generally transform the Desk to a state where it was fit for Gatwick to bring the service back in-house with Getronics’ support. All of this had to be achieved in just four months. Getronics transitioned 93 critical airport operational applications from India using onshore and near-shore support and resourcing. A full knowledge transfer took place within just two months, half the usual transition time, making way for a more stable environment, achieved by a team of people focused on delivering improvements as well as innovation. One Team, One Goal: User Satisfaction Getronics set out to demonstrate to Gatwick their ability to provide a higher quality of service, a flexible approach to delivering service excellence, and introduce best in class user interaction which translates to improved customer satisfaction. Within the first week of the Service Desk going live, the Gatwick IT Team started receiving positive feedback from the end-user community. This feedback was reflected in the Net Promoter Score (NPS) the Desk is measured by, which became a positive score for the first time in Gatwick Airport’s Service Desk history, increasing from the previous incumbent’s score of -37 to a record +4. Through the application transition work, a number of issues were uncovered that the airport wasn’t aware of, including out-of-date documentation, all of which were quickly resolved. One of the key accomplishments was Getronics’ approach to working with Gatwick’s other suppliers through a ‘One Team’ methodology. Effectively working together with other suppliers is a prerequisite for delivering best-in-class service to the airport and to achieve this we developed a collaboration platform that brings all the airport’s service providers together. All contracted SLAs were met or surpassed and Getronics was awarded Gatwick’s ‘ IT Team of The Year’, as voted for by Gatwick’s own IT staff. The Future With a lot of the discovery phase complete and foundations built, the focus is now firmly on driving IT innovation and improving the services delivered to both end-users and airport passengers. Getronics will focus on the application landscape in particular, helping the airport understand the true cost of those applications, before starting on an application transformation and rationalisation roadmap. This is one of the key principles that Gatwick will be focused on over the next 4 years, with the introduction of new services such as SaaS and IaaS. Longer term, the objective is to reduce the overall cost of IT and introduce more and more flexibility, all the while with a firm focus on driving innovation into the way they deliver services across Gatwick Airport. Why Getronics? The Getronics proposal and approach to delivering services were considered to be more dynamic due to several factors that distinguished us from the competition, for example, the experience of ITIL business processes and flexible approach to commercialising the service lots, as well as our considerable application development and management capabilities. Aside from low risk and cost effectiveness, Getronics’ ability to be adaptive to Gatwick’s evolving strategy and work well with other suppliers were critical factors that enabled the successful transition and improvement of IT services. In addition, as with any partnership, it comes down to effective working relationships. Gatwick met the Getronics delivery team before the contract was awarded and built relationships right up to Executive level, which was a differentiator."
